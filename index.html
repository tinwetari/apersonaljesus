    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! My name is Jane Doe and I am a full stack developer with a passion for all things outdoor. When I'm
      not coding, you can find me rock climbing or participating in other outdoor sports.
      I started my career as a quality engineer in the automotive industry, but I always had a fascination with
      programming. I began by learning automation and microcontroller programming, and eventually decided to pursue a
      career in web development. I taught myself HTML and JavaScript and have been working as a full stack developer for
      the past four years.
      Seven years ago, I made the move to Poland and have been enjoying all that the country has to offer. I am always
      looking for ways to expand my skills and knowledge, and I am excited to see where my career takes me next.
      Thanks for visiting my website! I hope you enjoy learning more about my work and interests.
    </p>
